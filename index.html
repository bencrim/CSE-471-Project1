    The instrument I added is technically, and should be graded as, an additive synthesizer. When first starting the project, I chose to create the Wavetable synth. After working through this for a while, I realized I made a weird amalgam between the Wavetable and additive synth, so I decided to pivot and complete the instrument as an additive synth. I outline this process because it explains my xml format below.
</p>
<p>
    To define the additive synth in the xml, you initialize it as such:<br>
    &lt;instrument instrument="Wavetable" waveform="Sine" harmonics="0.7 0.1 0.3 0.05 0.25 0.03 0.2 0.02 0.15 0.015 0.1 0.01"&gt;<br>
    You can see the artifact from when I first made the Wavetable, but this instrument is in fact an additive synth. The harmonics attribute is where users can define the amplitude of each harmonic they want to add to their sine wave. The fundamental harmonic is not included, since it is assumed to always be 1. The location of each value in the string determines which harmonic it is associated with.
</p>
<p>
    To define the effect components in the xml, you initialize them as such:<br>
    &lt;instrument instrument="NoiseGate"&gt;<br>
    &lt;instrument instrument="Compressor"&gt;<br>
    &lt;instrument instrument="Flanger"&gt;<br>
    <br>
    Then, you can define the properties of each effect as "notes" under the instrument. For example, the flanger effect defines its notes like this:<br>
    &lt;note measure="1" beat="1" effectDuration="10" maxDelayMs="5.0" lfoFrequency="0.75" depth="0.9" feedback="0.5"/&gt;<br>
    The specifics of each parameter will be covered below, but each effect has its own unique set of parameters that must be set to reasonable values.

    The score files used for the recordings can be found on my github <a href="https://github.com/bencrim/CSE-471-Project1">here</a>. The main musical selection is named "everything.score". The "drone" score files were used to test each effect individually, and the "fight2.score" file was adjusted to create example harmonic variations such as Sawtooth, Square, Triangle, etc. The harmonics used are given below:<br>
    Triangle: 0 1.0 0 0.1111 0 0.04 0 0.0204 0 0.0123 0 0.0083 0 0.0061 0<br>
    Sawtooth: 1.0 0.5 0.3333 0.25 0.2 0.1667 0.1429 0.125 0.1111 0.1 0.0909 0.0833 0.0769 0.0714<br>
    Buzzy: 0.8 0.4 0.6 0.2 0.4 0.1 0.3 0.05 0.2 0.025 0.15 0.0125<br>
    Hollow: 0 0.2 0 0.1 0 0.05 0 0.025 0 0.0125 0 0.00625<br>
    Vocal: 0.7 0.1 0.3 0.05 0.25 0.03 0.2 0.02 0.15 0.015 0.1 0.01
