<p>The instrument I added is technically, and should be graded as, an additive synthesizer. When first starting the project, I chose to create the Wavetable synth. After working through this for a while, I realized I made a weird amalgam between the Wavetable and additive synth, so I decided to pivot and complete the instrument as an additive synth. I outline this process because it explains my xml format below.</p>
<p>
    To define the additive synth in the xml, you initialize it as such:<br>
    &lt;instrument instrument="Wavetable" waveform="Sine" harmonics="0"&gt;
